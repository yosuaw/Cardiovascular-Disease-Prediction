# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

Train two machine learning models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression using Python Programming Language. After training the model, this two model's performance then compared to predict cardiovascular disease using Heart Disease dataset from UCI. As the result, the ANN model was chosen as the best machine learning model in classifying cardiovascular disease with 88,89% accuracy.
